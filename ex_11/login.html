    <hr>
    <p>We created our first form!!</p>
    <p>Go to index.html</p>
    <p>Input a username and password</p>
    <p>Submit the form by clicking on the submit button</p>
    <p>The browser will navigate to the login.html page</p>
    <p>Take a look at the URL to see the data that you just input on the previous form</p>
    <p>Now change the form method to be post instead of get and go over the last steps to input data, execute the form and look at the URL again to see the difference between these two methods :)</p>
